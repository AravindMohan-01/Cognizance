This program will allows the user to find whether the given number is divisible by 3 or not 

Main Function
Declare variables Num,IntRemainder as Integer
Declare variable RealRemainder as Real
OUTPUT "Enter the number to be checked"
INPUT Num
Assign IntRemainder equal to Num divide by 3      #Value will be stored as integer number
Assign RealRemainder equal to Num divide by 3     #Value will be stored as real number
IF IntRemainder is equal to RealRemainder then    #When the number is divisble by a number then the quotient will be a whole number 
   OUTPUT "True"
   ENDIF
ELSE
   OUTPUT "False"
   ENDELSE
END
