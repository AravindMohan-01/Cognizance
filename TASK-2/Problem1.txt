This program will allows the user to find whether the given number is divisible by 3 or not 

BEGIN
Declare variables num,intremainder as Integer
Declare variable realremainder as Real
OUTPUT "Enter the number to be checked"
INPUT num
Assign intremainder equal to num divide by 3      #Value will be stored as integer number
Assign realremainder equal to num divide by 3     #Value will be stored as real number
IF intremainder is equal to realremainder then    #When the number is divisble by a number then the quotient will be a whole number 
   OUTPUT "True"
   ENDIF
ELSE
   OUTPUT "False"
   ENDELSE
END
