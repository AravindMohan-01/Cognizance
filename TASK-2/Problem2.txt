BEGIN
Declare variables a,b,n and,element as Integer
OUTPUT "Enter the value of n that need to be displayed"
INPUT n
Assign a to 0, b to 1 and, element to 0
WHILE n is greater than 0
   Assign element = a + b             #element will be the numbers in the Fibonacci Series
   Assign b to a and, a to element    #Moving forward to next element
   Decrement n by 1
   ENDWHILE
OUTPUT element                        #The required element of the Fibonacci Series will be displayed
